## 📌 Overview
Customer churn analysis is a critical process that helps businesses understand why customers leave and how to retain them. This project utilizes **Python and Power BI** to analyze customer churn patterns, visualize key insights, and predict potential churn using machine learning models.

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Uncovering trends and correlations in churn behavior.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models** – Implementing predictive models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- 📈 **Power BI Dashboards** – Creating interactive visualizations for better business insights.
- 📉 **Churn Prediction** – Identifying high-risk customers to improve retention strategies.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Power BI** (Data visualization and dashboarding)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (For data processing and modeling)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
